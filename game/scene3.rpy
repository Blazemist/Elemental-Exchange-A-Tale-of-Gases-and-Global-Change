    r "Gramps are you alright too? No itching?"
    gp "I’m as fine and dandy as can be."
    ls "You children have got a very serious message from our spirits I assume?"
    r "If you consider those tiny gas molecules spirits, sure!"
    ls "They all are ways of the universe to interact with us."
    h "This is such a horrid hell-mare."
    gm "Havana my love, are you feeling good?"
    h "Yes gran but we have work to do. I had the wildest dream about greenhouse gasses and River was part of it"
    r "Yeah."
    ls "I’ll help in any way I can especially when it comes to beliefs. Many of our folks have gone plant blind, not conserving our local flora, instead contributing to cement plants."
    h "Thank you so much."
    r "Splendid! Also Doctor could you see to it that the hospital switches to HFO for ACs in hospitals rather than HFCs because they have lesser GWP? We should let everyone else know about this."
    d "You kids are going to make me a doctor of climate too at this rate."
    d "I will see to it with the higher ups."
